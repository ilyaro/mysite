<h2>Scorpions - Wind of Change</h2>
<p>Follow the Moskva<br>
Down to Gorky Park<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
An August summer night<br>
Soldiers passing by<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
<br>
The world is closing in<br>
Did you ever think<br>
That we could be so close, like brothers<br>
The future&#39;s in the air<br>
Can feel it everywhere<br>
Blowing with the wind of change<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change<br>
<br>
Walking down the street<br>
Distant memories<br>
Are buried in the past, forever<br>
I follow the Moskva<br>
Down to Gorky Park<br>
Listening to the wind of change<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams<br>
With you and me<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change<br>
<br>
The wind of change<br>
Blows straight into the face of time<br>
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell<br>
For peace of mind<br>
Let your balalaika sing<br>
What my guitar wants to say<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams<br>
With you and me<br>
<br>
Take me to the magic of the moment<br>
On a glory night<br>
Where the children of tomorrow dream away<br>
In the wind of change</p>
