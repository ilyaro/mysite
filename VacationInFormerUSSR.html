<center><h3>Vacation in Former Soviet Union.</h3></center>
<pre>
Moscow the capital of Russian Federation and Polotsk, Belarus republic, Vitebsk
district were our destination.
From 6 June to 20 June 14 days.
	I ordered the tickets in Mona Tours at night flights of TransAero
airlines, Russian company.Visa to Russian Federation for my wife I ordered in
Flying Carpet in Tel Aviv.Visa cost 75$ USA, plus health insurance 35$ USA.
	My wife Marina Rokhkin hasn't neither Russian
nor Belarus passport only Israeli passport.
So I ordered for her Visa to Russia for 14 days.
When we got her Israeli passport, there was notice in Russian and English.
So that while being in Russia we SHOULD register in company Visa Center in
Moscow, otherwise she brakes the low of being in Russia.
Registration cost money and not being registered you may be fined 30$ a day
in Russia.Also below there was small notice, that you may also register in
any hotel in Russia.But we even didn't notice it, because Visa Center was
in big bald letters.So it was clear for us that Marina must register at
Visa Center in Moscow.
	Before 3 days of flight I was called, saying that all night flights
of TransAero moved to morning flights.I was sent fax approving it, but the
problem was that 20 June night flight was moved to 21 June, but Marina's
Visa expired in 20 June.

We flied to Moscow Domodedovo Airport, the biggest Airport in Russia,
situated in Moscow district, souther from Moscow.
Tatiana and Sasha my sister's friends met us at air port we gave them what
my sister asked me to give them.
	And we waited for my nephews Anya and Luba 30 minutes because of their car
and so that they lived in opposite side of Moscow Sokol Metro North of Moscow.
It was very funny experience to travel in their car "Moskvich" that now is not
produced and we drove 40 km/hour and in 3 hours we was at their home.
In comparison flight from Tel Aviv to Moscow took us about the same time.
	When we came to their home the wild cat was waiting for us and growl
to us because we were strangers for him. But more over it attacked us.
One day it attacked my heel and Luba a doctor put me spirit on the heel not
to catch infection.
	We were not given keys from the apartment so when everybody come out
from the apartment we MUST also go out to a street.And wait until evening
then Luba comes back for her hospital.
When we eat with the family Zusman we talked about or family especially
about Lina my step sister that passed away in 1999 from cancer of breast.
I got a lot of new information I never knew before, so we with Marina couldn't
sleep at night, but we spoke.
	In our second day in Moscow we go to the bloody Visa Center company,
where we were taken 50$ per registration in Russian federation.
When real registration in any hotel costs 15$.
The Israeli company Flying Carpet makes such money for foolish and innocent
people.
What was really good in Moscow it is theater "SATIRY" with Aroseva staring.
We laughed all the play. The play was a premiere and it's name was "Not a centime less".
	I met my University friends in Sauna. It was birthday of one of our friends
Alexei.We played billiard, ping pong, sing karaoke. It was real fun in sauna with
Univecity friends.
	Next day we were in our way to Polotsk Belarus.
We were thrilled that Marina would be expelled from wagon because she didn't have
Belarus VISA. We were tell not to speak Hebrew.
All the night we didn't sleep because of this.
But no one check us no customs were at all.
When we arrived to Polotsk Belarus Sasha and Olya were waiting us at train station.
	We took taxi and moved to their home.
First thing that took my attention was notice in the bus.
Passenger without ticked pay "Base Value" about 18$ USA but if the passenger
is driver he/she pays 3 "Base Value".
We were very tired because 12 hours travel in train so we get sleep in one moment.
